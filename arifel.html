        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
Born in the deep ice mountains in the village of Howlspear, Arifel descends from a long lineage of Silver Dragons. And as such she possesses many of the qualities of them such as a benevolent nature, regal appearance, and shapeshifting.
Her most blessed gift is to call upon water in its most solid form to defend herself and her family. Raised amongst others with similar gifts, she found her calling through the arcane arts and natural magic. She is gifted with her aptitude for history and her thirst
of knowledge of the multiverse. Being stuck in one location for her young life has made her impatient to see the world even with the warnings from her family.
<br><br>
At reaching the age of 15 and being a fresh adult, she began her spirtual journey and traveling across several southern cities. She found knowledge but also prejudice and at times resistance. This didn't change, however she began having headaches followed by dreams
filled with death. Arifel began searching for answers when the dreams led to visions of a dark, smokey figure in the shape of a young woman. Her travels continued and so did the dreams. Some brought along with them feelings and emotions that weren't always understood.
Some of the dreams came from memories or visions that weren't Arifel's. She spent some time studying at Kelmha in Kelmhagen, an Archmage's library and sanctum. One evening, the Archmage introduced her to Necromancer Riddick Alexsander. Arifel had never looked much into
necromancy and after expressing some interest, he asked her to stop by Gravemarch if she ever made it that far North.
<br><br>
Ultimately, her dream and studies did draw her North. The young woman from her dreams became clearer, each vision and dream pulling them closer together. Until they could fully see one another in the dream, only then were they able to psychically chat with each other.
This allowed her to find Cienna Elarocen in Gravemarch. 
<br><br>
A few years of tutlage under Alexsander and Cienna, her now best friend, Arifel found a place for herself in this world. Making friends and acquaintances with most of the Noble families in the city, she grew in recognition and know for her gentle demeanor.
She still wanders and seeks out knowledge, traveling where she must as Cienna makes sure she is never alone.
