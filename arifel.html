        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
Born in the deep ice mountains in the village of Howlspear, Arifel descends from a long lineage of Silver Dragons. And as such she possesses many of the qualities of them such as a benevolent nature, regal appearance, and shapeshifting.
Her most blessed gift is to call upon water in its most solid form to defend herself and her family. Raised amongst others with similar gifts, she found her calling through the arcane arts and natural magic. She is gifted with her aptitude for history and her thirst
of knowledge of the multiverse. Being stuck in one location for her young life has made her impatient to see the world even with the warnings from her family.
<br><br>
At reaching the age of 15 and being a fresh adult, she began her spirtual journey and traveling across several southern cities. She found knowledge but also prejudice and at times resistance. This didn't change, however she began having headaches followed by dreams
filled with death. Arifel began searching for answers when the dreams led to visions of a dark, smokey figure in the shape of a young woman. Her travels continued and so did the dreams. Some brought along with them feelings and emotions that weren't always understood.
Some of the dreams came from memories or visions that weren't Arifel's. She spent some time studying at Kelmha in Kelmhagen, an Archmage's library and sanctum. One evening, the Archmage introduced her to Necromancer Riddick Alexsander. Arifel had never looked much into
necromancy and after expressing some interest, he asked her to stop by Gravemarch if she ever made it that far North.
<br><br>
Ultimately, her dream and studies did draw her North. The young woman from her dreams became clearer, each vision and dream pulling them closer together. Until they could fully see one another in the dream, only then were they able to psychically chat with each other.
This allowed her to find Cienna Elarocen in Gravemarch. 
<br><br>
A few years of tutlage under Alexsander and Cienna, her now best friend, Arifel found a place for herself in this world. Making friends and acquaintances with most of the Noble families in the city, she grew in recognition and know for her gentle demeanor.
She still wanders and seeks out knowledge, traveling where she must as Cienna makes sure she is never alone.

        <h3>Dreams</h3>
        <p>
          Cienna appears in your dreams and her aura is darkening. She is no longer as vivid or clear as she had been before. Another darker, black figure appears. This one you can't see anything about other than larger is stature and beefy. You also feel like something
          or someone out there is watching you.

          <p>The Twilight of the Eight - The Last Age of the Divine
          In the beginning, the Eight shaped the world not as conquerors, but as caretakers. They forged a realm where peace was law, harmony was sacred, and corruption had no place.
          They carved the world of Nocctherra from the stars and chiseled out the regions from the North to the South.
          Their united purpose became known as the Pact of Dawn—a vow to protect creation from the rot of greed, ambition, and malice.
          <br><br>
          But the very world they shaped grew thriving, diverse, and full of mortal wills. Peace bred prosperity; prosperity bred desire; desire bred envy—and thus the first seeds of darkness were born 
          within mortals, not beyond them.
          <br><br>
          It was not an external evil that doomed the gods.
          It was the proof that their perfect world could not remain perfect.
          <br><br>
          Whispers turned to schemes. Schemes turned to factions. Factions turned to bloodshed. And in their attempts to intervene and preserve their dream, the gods stretched themselves thin, 
          became vulnerable, and finally—fell to the consequences of their own creation.
          <br><br>
          Their end was not caused by mortals directly, but by the cosmic imbalance that formed when the Eight poured too much of themselves into preserving peace, weakening the divine fabric that sustained them.
          <br><br>
          The Twilight of the Eight was not one event.
          It was eight tragedies, each unfolding in the same era, each echoing the failing world they loved too fiercely.
            <br><br>
            The Eight
            Aetherion — God of Sky, Stars, and Destiny
            <br><br>
            A calm, far-seeing deity who speaks in omens and constellations.
            <br><br>
            Vashara — Goddess of Storms, Fury, and Trial
            <br><br>
            Wild, unpredictable, and revered by warriors and sailors.
            <br><br>
            Tharos — God of Stone, Endurance, and Oaths
            <br><br>
            A titan-like figure carved from mountain and time.
            <br><br>
            Lythra — Goddess of Secrets, Shadows, and Hidden Knowledge
            <br><br>
            Worshiped by spies, seers, and those who walk between worlds.
            <br><br>
            Morveth — God of Death, Memory, and the Silent Path
            <br><br>
            Cold but not cruel; keeper of every story ever lived and lost.
            <br><br>
            Seralyne — Goddess of Life, Hearth, and Mercy
            <br><br>
            Warm, luminous, and fiercely protective of families and small wonders.
            <br><br>
            Kaelith — Goddess of War, Honor, and Sacred Conflict
            <br><br>
            A patron of disciplined warriors rather than brute slaughter.
            <br><br>
            Orosin — God of Creation, Art, and Inspiration
            <br><br>
            The dreamer and architect of reality; artists claim to hear his “whispers.”

        <button class="session-toggle">The Ancients</button>
          <div class="session-content">
          <p>The Ancients came into being after the time of The Gods. This is a collective of individuals who remain as close to the divine as anyone would hope to get. They possess remarkable abilities within their realm
            and also with specific gifts for out of realm experiences. To put simply, these are the known deities worshipped today and there powers are nothing to snuff at. They can bring great light or great darkness. The
            Ancients agreed to form a Council to temper their own inclinations called The Eclipsed Concord. Within they decreed that no Ancient would act alone when it came to issues that would surely arise. And from then on
            The Eclipsed Concord has settled skirmishes, defeated great foes, and protected the people under them. The are most commonly known as The Ancients and less known as the Eclipsed Concord. Exactly how they want
            it. These entities wish to remain hidden from the world. They want to walk and interact with the world as if they were ordinary. To reveal themselves would spark an unknown era of power struggles or worse another annihilation
            event that took out The Gods in the first place. Some people claim to have met an Ancient, then later unable to recollect the interaction. 
            <br><br>
            Many of the Ancients assumed their abilities when The Gods perished. Many of them walked in the close circles of The Gods. If they escaped the initial culling of magically folk after The Gods fell, they were able
            to escape into the world. Fragments of the Godly power resides within them and each has retained a different percentage of that power. Make no mistake, there both light and dark Ancients. Within the Spellcaster's
            libraries around Nocctherra, there are a few entries in diaries and highly guarded texts which reveals the identity of a few of the Ancients. One said identity is an Elven woman known as The Matron formally, yet is 
            able to manipulate her appearance to appear as anyone she wish. People often recollect a beautiful night full of pleasure and love with this Ancient, however others have gone mad trying to remember her. Her true name
            remains a mystery. It is theorized the true name of an Ancient can bind them.
            <br><br>
            The accounts of these Ancients reveal that there are only about sixteen of them in existence and have existed since they were created. There is very little information on just how old they truly are or the extent
            of their powers. And in line, how to destroy or find them is also left to the imagination. As per history, an Ancient has never been killed. 
            <br><br>
            The Ancients have over time gained names based upon their actions or assistances in history. There is The Matron, The Patron, The Weaver, The Oracle, The Sire, The Oath-Breaker, The Rootfather, The Rootmother,
            The Echo, The Elder, The Nameless, The Veiled Queen, The Iron Shepard, The Dawnmaiden, The Keeper, and The Last Light.
