        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cienna Elarocen</p>
        <p><strong>Race:</strong> Human</p>
        <p><strong>Class:</strong> Sorcerer</p>
        <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> TBD</p>

        <p>
          Cienna Elarocen is the eldest child of the Elarocen Noble family. She is the daughter of Theodara and Elric Elarocen and sister to Lucien. At 21, she is focusing her studies as she is determined to become a White Necromancer, specifically one that 
          use their connection to life and death for good, often honoring the dead to aid the living. She resides in Gravemarch at the Elarocen family home and attends Mortalis Collegium regurarly. She is a top student and has completed 14 grave marches in 
          which she was the prominent spellcaster to raise the dead.
          <br><br>
          Necromancy has many subcategories and Gravemarch has a few different distinctions because of its curious life and death components that sit on top of each other. Cienna has spent some time studying the Ephi language, long lost language of souls and 
          encryption techniques for messages. These fields have gathered her interest along with that of the Death Walkers. Being a child of a Death Walker, she possesses a few rarer abilities which are suggestive traits of Death Walkers children although she 
          remains undeclared. This being her ability to give sight to herself or those she can extrapolate her magic too and invisibility. This can unveil the darkness or can allow seeing into the Ethereal plane. She is learning how to slip between the worlds 
          of the living and the dead although this is a particularly tricky component to successfully completing her training.
          <br><br>
          The murders and disappearances in Gravemarch have unsettled the population and its Necromancer's. Cienna is devoted to her family and her people and will stop at nothing to do everything in her power to restore the balance. Although, she has discovered 
          two of the brutal murders, one at Mortalis Collegium and another at the Southern Gates, she has become apprehensive and withdrawn. For good reason, yet unlike Cienna. She still works to fight whatever is plaguing Gravemarch and the surrounding villages, 
          yet fights even more fiercely to preserve the appearance of whole Noble families who are fighting for the people.
          <br><br>
          Meanwhile, Cienna's home life has declined with the state of her mother and father. She devotes as much time and assistance to keeping it hidden yet try to heal her family. Her visions are worsening and the only person she trusts with the inner details of
          her life is Arifel. A dragonborn druid that it far more connected to Cienna that any other being alive. Her visions are fading which is never a good sign, and her clear connection with Arifel is muddled.
