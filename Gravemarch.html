        <h2>Problem at Gravemarch</h2>
        <p>Once a bustling necromancy city, now it pales in comparison. People are almost to even utter the words to a spell. People, students, Nobles, anyone who practices necromancy have begun disappearing
        or are displayed for the public after being brutally slain. Mortalis Collegium went from thousands of students to only a class of 135. Many families have abandoned the city claiming its too dangerous
        and flee anywhere that would accept them. This has taken palce over the last year and the Noble families have worked together to attack the problem. Only to perish themselves. Some Noble families
        have been nearly wiped off the map. Some only have 1 surviving member and close to being dead family names. Nothing they have done has stopped the disappearance or killings. The only thing that has saved
        lives is people having stopped practicing necromancy at all costs.</p>

        <h2>Mortalis Collegium</h2>
        <p>The school was originally built as a monastery to cover its practices to the outside world. Those who wished to study necromancy became Monks of the Grave. At that time, this land was barren and free
        of prying eyes and those who abhore necromancy. Those who studied here were there for the pursuit of knowledge and to understand the power/veil between life and death. Many went on to be the great Noble
        necromancer's such as the founding families of necromancy: Anthorpe, Castyne, Mortavec, Tenebreux, Sablemere, Carthraven, and Elarocen. These families have strong blood and a very distinct talent for the art.
        They helped build up the school and the city around it. The building themselves have been many things, hospital, libraries, classrooms, mortuary, dungeon, school, and a sanctuary.</p>
