              <h3>The Northern Spires</h3>
                
              <pre>The Northern most region of the country of Nocctherra and home to the Tuk People. While most of the region is covered in barren land, it is guarded by the active volcanic peaks of Khar'mir. The ruins still remain as a remnant of an ancient society that once worshipped the volcanoes power and was the source of many magics of the time. Or so it was believed.Until the event, Breath of Khar, wiped out the civilization and most of its original people. 
The North is also home to the the village of Colideep, the infamous witch coven, Witchglass, and the Tuk people, an elusive mix of races, social outcasts, and those abandoned by their own. Travelers are warned away from the North especially those unable to protect themselves.</pre>
                <br>
                <h4>Colideep</h4>
                    <pre>
                        
                    </pre>
                <h4>Khar'mir</h4>
                <h4>Witchglass</h4>

              <h3>Mid-Region</h3>
                <pre>A mix of lands and people.</pre>

                <h4>Ashmaw Crevasse</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Cinder</h4>
                        <pre> A decent sized town that has grown in conjuction with Gravemarch. It's livelihood depends on the manufacturing and retail of potions and saught after, hand crafted magic items. It has a distinct tourist feel to it as festivals and parties are a common theme. Money from mediocre tricks and illusions.  
                        It is home primarly to spellcasters that spend their time and pour their energy into the art of the arcane and magics. Still drawn to the darker side, Gravemarch provides easy access and knowledge should they be willing to learn. 
                        Cinder doesn't worship Kelemvor as most neighboring villages do. Instead, they worship Kossuth, the God of Elemental Fire and Purification through fire. The magic in the area favors fire and such has burnt down parts of the town on a number of occassions. 
                        Flame Courtesans can be seen at night often trying to take the the newcomers beyond the town. Some locals will give warning, others will leave one to their own stupidity. Never trust a Flame Courtesan. </pre>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Coldrest</h4>
                    <pre>A small village that has seen the years weather the humble beginnings of living on the plains. Buildings are mostly made from wood and adobe that is provided by the lands. At first glance, this place would seem to be home to the peasantly and undesirables, however one Noble family has devoted their lives to taking care and providing for those less fortunate. They don't believe in living separate from those whom they wish to help. The true identity of this family remains widely unknown amongst the locals. It is wondered if the Noble family still resides amongst them or they have become a legend themselves. <br> Leisure and comfort are lost upon this place, yet many choose to reside here for the closeness to Gravemarch and the prospect of a better life. <br></pre>
                <h4>Cradle Cove</h4>
                <h4>Duskworn</h4>
                <h4>Ebonreach</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Gravemarch</h4>
                    <pre>The largest city in the surrounding plains and the foundation for Necromancy in Nocctherra. Originally, built through the rise of Mortalis Collegium and the 7 Noble families that reside there. 
                    Over time the city became known for its knowledge and reverence for death. Many healers, seers, and death walkers came from this city. Many from notable families from both north and south regions. The city gained power and prestige over most of the surrounding land and forbid the punishments for using necromancy as are prominent in other cities and lands. 
                    Smaller towns, Rookstead, Cinder, and Coldrest, developed and grew as Gravemarch did. Many wanted to learn and study at Mortalis Collegium and at one point the school had thousands of students each year. 
                    It is an old city yet still regains its elegance and haunted nature. While elcletic in its people and their customs, Death Marches are what gave Gravemarch its name.
                    Everyone is celebrated at their death regardless of title or class as everyone dies and death is honored. After someone passes, a ceremony and procession is held in which the deceased is marched through the city to there gravesite. <br></pre>
                <h4>Neverwomb</h4>
                <h4>Nightfen</h4>
                <h4>Nyxxor</h4>
                <h4>Ossaria</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Rookstead</h4>
                    <pre>The largest of the surrounding towns and by far the most elegant. This is the place where diplomats and dignitaries will stay often when visiting to discuss trade and business with Gravemarch Noble families.
                    The architecture of the buildings and the over done strangeness of the design will baffle and amaze any tourist.
                    Those that live in Rookstead on a lesser level than the high class exist with silence and precision.
                    They focus on their daily lives and usually work for the high class in some capacity. It is a private town and its locals keep to themselves. If you can walk and talk with the best of them, beware of the sharks in the water.
                    Gravemarch may be home to the necromancers, Rookstead is home to those without souls.
                    They thrive in merchant deals, luxury and extravagance, and often times the smuggling of rare goods from other regions of Nocctherra. If you can't find something you need, Rookstead would be the place to start looking. <br></pre>

                Ever since, adventurers and common folk alike who travel up near witchglass lake are often never heard from again. Those that have on a rare occassion, are forever changed.
