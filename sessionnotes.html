            <p>Theodara dies. Since Arifel and Flux can see the dead, they see Theodara's spirit rise from her body. Her spirit begins to gather her surroudnings as she begins to comprehend she died. She recognizes Arifel warming to her immediately. <em>Protect my husband,
            my children. Keep them out of The Dark. Don't let Lucien or any others come after me. The exposure isn't worth the risk. Stay safe sweetheart. Know you'll always have my love.</em> Turns to Flux. <em>So many things I want to say and can't. My tattoo, it'll help

            together they find a new note for Flux. Another cryptic note like others he has gotten. And they notice the Sigil on her tomb is plucked out. They then head over to the Anthorpe crypt as they hear knocking on the inside. The pass through the false door paying a
            certain price for entry. They discovered two teenage boys stealing the sigils from the crypts and selling them to cloaked figures in Rookstead. Flux pieces together Evelyn Castyne's and they all receive a three visions.

            he is making on purpose, they run. Suddenly, a giant ball of multicolored lights heads for the phylactery. A woman appears wearing red and black, with red hair and seemingly opens a doorway for Theodara to escape and Lucien to emerge from his trance. 
            Together, they all run as the phylactery teleports out of The Dark and the woman dissolves back into the light. Devilayne confronts them and gets them all back to Gravemarch where they receive a scolding of a lifetime. They foiled the others plans and are

        <section class="session-note">
        <button class="session-toggle">Session 3: Bloodlines</button>
          <div class="session-content">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>After a lecture from Devilayne Anthorpe, everyone has disappeared back into the town at around 5pm. Flux and Arifel both eat their Spirit Skewer's and the world comes alive again. Maribel appears 
            again and gets them to go to the Tavern. Where in they discover a bar brawl has broken out with burn blasts on the wall where the Dead and Missing Boards have been moved to behind the bartender. 
            He says hi to Flux and as they chat with him, the bartender reveals that the Mortavec's stopped by and placed Nara's picture on the Missing Board. They then head out to the cemetery and to the patch
            of big old oaks. After a bit of testing the waters, Flux and Arifel figure out how to get into the sanctuary. 'Let me be worthy.' They get inside and begin to investigate. They hear skittering and notice
            the desk chair appears toppled over. Arifel investigates the desk and dives into some of Nara's Journal Entries. Flux catches one of the skittering hands and a fight between them ensues. They beat them and 
            Arifel notices a quartz dove with a pearl eye and a black raven with an onyx eye in her collected artifacts table. This catches Arifel's attention as she begins to fiddle with the both of them. She finds out
            the dove is in its true form, however when she plays with the Raven and pushes in its eye, it transform into a letter with the seal of a Raven. Reveals the love note from Raven to Dove. Flux investigates the
            pile of papers on the floor discovering a few riddled messages. Flux and Arifel work together and solve the riddles. At solving them, they see the moment that Nara was taken and the figure that took her. It was dark
            and indistinguisable, yet very there. Flux then takes a look at the bracelet on her desk realizing the importance of it. They also learn she is a Spire. Afterwards, they head to the crypts and fiddle with the Anthorpe
            Sigil. They discover that they can pull the blocks below the name in and out. They nearly discover a scene between Axtyne and Ravena and accidently call Devilayne to them. She is less than thrilled yet 
            helps them figure out how to reach the Spires of Lineage. Devilayne's being pulled out makes the Spire symbol light up and she matches her tattoo to it. Then she disappears again. They go into it and Flux 
            witnesses the room come alive. A cathedral like library with a specter that explains the rules of what it means to be a Spire. He sees the Anthorpe lineage, no spectral line, and then views the history
            of long ago with the Queen Necromancer and her fragments. The scene reveals Nara augmenting the Anthorpe lineage. Then Arifel feels a big surge in her chest. They then head out for the evening and end
            up at Devilayne's for the evening. She lets them in and Arifel and Flux notice the beautiful quartz dove on the mantel. At bidding them goodnight, Arifel retorts, 'Goodnight Raven'. Devilayne glares at her
            almost as if the name registered with her. Then she heads to bed without a word. In the middle of the night, Devilayne raps on the door waking them both in a panic. Arifel wakes with seeing Cienna collapse
            and she loses her connection with her. They wake up only to discover the brutal kidnapping scene unfold as Devilayne rushes to Lucien, a hole ripped in his side, two holes in his neck, and barely alive. 
            Devilayne tries to help him as Arifel and Flux take a look at the damaged walls from fire blasts as blood spatters the
            wall. Cedric Castyne comes down the stairs and reveals that Elric went after Cienna. As Devilayne works on Lucien, her brooch is revealed as a Raven and a Dove circling each other. A necklace dangles
            with a vial attached. Cedric tries to console Arifel.</p>
