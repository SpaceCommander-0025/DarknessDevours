          <div class="session-content">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Theodara dies. Since Arifel and Flux can see the dead, they see Theodara's spirit rise from her body. Her spirit begins to gather her surroudnings as she begins to comprehend she died. She recognizes Arifel warming to her immediately. <em>Protect my husband,
            my children. Keep them out of The Dark. Don't let Lucien or any others come after me. The exposure isn't worth the risk. Stay safe sweetheart. Know you'll always have my love.</em> Turns to Flux. <em>So many things I want to say and can't. My tattoo, it'll help
            you understand yourself dear boy. That and the flames.</em> Theodara sinks into the floor bound in a black, viscous vine. 
            <br><br>
            Afterwards, Flux and Arifel decide to head to the cemetery and discover footprints into the different crypts. They check out the Mortavec Crypt and discover and illusionary lid to Nara Mortavec's coffin although she isn't dead yet. Flux discovers the illusion and
            together they find a new note for Flux. Another cryptic note like others he has gotten. And they notice the Sigil on her tomb is plucked out. They then head over to the Anthorpe crypt as they hear knocking on the inside. The pass through the false door paying a
            certain price for entry. They discovered two teenage boys stealing the sigils from the crypts and selling them to cloaked figures in Rookstead. Flux pieces together Evelyn Castyne's and they all receive a three visions. 
            <br><br>
            They check on Nara and she isn't home. They decide to spend the night with the Castyne's and drink a weird hot elixir that gives them a good nights sleep. They both have strange dreams. They wake and head to the library the next day. The pass by the adult

            Once inside, they discover an entire new biome of animals and plants, including some unpleasantly types. They discover a phylactery with Theodara inside. After seeing a corrupted Lucien with the beggings of Theodara to leave and the sheer amount of sound
            he is making on purpose, they run. Suddenly, a giant ball of multicolored lights heads for the phylactery. A woman appears wearing red and black, with red hair and seemingly opens a doorway for Theodara to escape and Lucien to emerge from his trance. 
            Together, they all run as the phylactery teleports out of The Dark and the woman dissolves back into the light. Devilayne confronts them and gets them all back to Gravemarch where they receive a scolding of a lifetime. They foiled the others plans and are

        <section class="session-note">
        <button class="session-toggle">Session 3: Bloodlines</button>
          <div class="session-content">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>After a lecture from Devilayne Anthorpe, everyone has disappeared back into the town at around 5pm. Flux and Arifel both eat their Spirit Skewer's and the world comes alive again. Maribel appears 
            again and gets them to go to the Tavern. Where in they discover a bar brawl has broken out with burn blasts on the wall where the Dead and Missing Boards have been moved to behind the bartender. 
            He says hi to Flux and as they chat with him, the bartender reveals that the Mortavec's stopped by and placed Nara's picture on the Missing Board. 
            <br><br>
            They then head out to the cemetery and to the patch
            of big old oaks. After a bit of testing the waters, Flux and Arifel figure out how to get into the sanctuary. 'Let me be worthy.' They get inside and begin to investigate. They hear skittering and notice
            the desk chair appears toppled over. Arifel investigates the desk and dives into some of Nara's Journal Entries. Flux catches one of the skittering hands and a fight between them ensues. They beat them and 
            Arifel notices a quartz dove with a pearl eye and a black raven with an onyx eye in her collected artifacts table. This catches Arifel's attention as she begins to fiddle with the both of them. She finds out
            the dove is in its true form, however when she plays with the Raven and pushes in its eye, it transform into a letter with the seal of a Raven. Reveals the love note from Raven to Dove. Flux investigates the
            pile of papers on the floor discovering a few riddled messages. Flux and Arifel work together and solve the riddles. At solving them, they see the moment that Nara was taken and the figure that took her. It was dark
            and indistinguisable, yet very there. Flux then takes a look at the bracelet on her desk realizing the importance of it. They also learn she is a Spire. 
            <br><br>
            Afterwards, they head to the crypts and fiddle with the Anthorpe
            Sigil. They discover that they can pull the blocks below the name in and out. They nearly discover a scene between Axtyne and Ravena and accidently call Devilayne to them. She is less than thrilled yet 
            helps them figure out how to reach the Spires of Lineage. Devilayne's being pulled out makes the Spire symbol light up and she matches her tattoo to it. Then she disappears again. They go into it and Flux 
            witnesses the room come alive. A cathedral like library with a specter that explains the rules of what it means to be a Spire. He sees the Anthorpe lineage, no spectral line, and then views the history
            of long ago with the Queen Necromancer and her fragments. The scene reveals Nara augmenting the Anthorpe lineage. Then Arifel feels a big surge in her chest. 
            <br><br>
            They then head out for the evening and end
            up at Devilayne's for the evening. She lets them in and Arifel and Flux notice the beautiful quartz dove on the mantel. At bidding them goodnight, Arifel retorts, 'Goodnight Raven'. Devilayne glares at her
            almost as if the name registered with her. Then she heads to bed without a word. In the middle of the night, Devilayne raps on the door waking them both in a panic. Arifel wakes with seeing Cienna collapse
            and she loses her connection with her. They wake up only to discover the brutal kidnapping scene unfold as Devilayne rushes to Lucien, a hole ripped in his side, two holes in his neck, and barely alive. 
            Devilayne tries to help him as Arifel and Flux take a look at the damaged walls from fire blasts as blood spatters the
            wall. Cedric Castyne comes down the stairs and reveals that Elric went after Cienna. As Devilayne works on Lucien, her brooch is revealed as a Raven and a Dove circling each other. A necklace dangles
            with a vial attached. Cedric tries to console Arifel.</p>

        <button class="session-toggle">Session 4: For A Friend</button>
          <div class="session-content">
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Arifel and Flux take a closer look as the scene unfolds. Lucien greatly wounded, stomach ripped open, Devilayne tending to him. The heads of the other Noble Houses have made there way to the scene.
            The Mortavec’s argue with Devilayne against the use of necromantic magic to save his life. She does it anyway. Flux eats a Spirit Skewer and watches Theodara. She makes Arifel and Flux touch a 
            depression in the floor. Flux sees Nara in a cell, vampire bite in her neck. Arifel sees Cienna and a pull towards the cemetery. Cienna says ‘Please don’t let my father turn!’ 
            <br><br>
            Arifel and Flux head out toward the cemetery. Devilayne offers after picking Lucien up, ‘Don’t get yourselves killed!’ As they get to the cemetery, a battle has ensued as necromantic energy lights 
            up the sky in red flashes. They all join the fight. The spawn pulls Death Cores from the Death Fountain and the other one gets eaten by it. Elric turns into a Harbinger and turns everything against 
            Arifel, Flux, Cienna, and Theodara. As the spawn evaporates and teleports away with Cienna, the others are left to deal with the Harbinger. Theodara sacrifices herself to take care of the Elric which 
            is turn destroys them both. Arifel gathers a Death Core as she notices the Cloaks of Theodara and Elric reappear. She puts it on and feels a connection to Cienna and Nara together in the cell. Flux puts
            on Elric’s and is shown the events of the kidnapping, his last sentiments toward his daughter and trying to save her, and then the last moment before he loses control. Power still lives in the cloaks. 
            Nobles from the city came and Maribel created a beautiful silver and green tombstone with their names engraved only to cry. The second most powerful necromancy family has lost both its head family members.
            <br><br>
            Arifel and Flux evaporate and are transported into cells where they have to figure out how to get out of their cells. There are carvings in the stone floor and scrolls hidden in the walls. 
            Together they shout across the opening to their cells and finally figure out the combination to unlock their cells. Once out they check out the other cells. One is the used, lived in cell. 
            Notes scrawled across the desk, some to Raven even though they won’t get there. Another has been home to a halfling cartographer and her map familiar. Another to a pixie named Oak. 
            Another to a pair of birds a Dove and a Raven. Arifel speaks to the birds asking them where Cienna is? Nara? The Dove flies to the other cell and the Raven follows. Oak reveals the spiders as Flux 
            and Arifel kill the spiders producing the colors they need to unlock all the cells. Arifel searches the girl’s cell and then holds both the Dove and the Raven in her hand. Arifel enters another 
            mindscape and see the Dove fly to the other side of the ritual circle that is familiar to Arifel. The Raven flies opposite and then a mist floats around. A bond between the Raven and the Dove pierces
            through to their hearts. Then mists then has tentacles that pierces their hearts making a 3-way triangle of bond. Arifel comes back to the cell as the birds fly back to their cell. She checks the book
            case and finds 62 markings suggesting they have been there for almost two months. Arifel also feels the ancient magic attached to these birds, the pixie, this place. Flux frees Oak and Oak swears 
            a life debt to Flux becoming his familiar. Together, they head out of the cells.

  <div class="session-content">
    <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Arifel and Flux take on The Garden with Oak and Gandra at their back. The vines gave them some trouble especially Arifel who found herself entangled and smacked a few times. 
      Oak and Arifel bantered a bit until he himself were entangled too. Flux however found a secret entrance through a side of wall vines and ultimately went into a bird aviary where many Ravens and Doves flew about the room. 
      <br><br>
      Having had enough with the vines grabbing at her, Arifel fired a cold, icy blast and froze them in place to join Flux in the bird aviary. Arifel remembered her vision from before and makes a plan to try and
      coax the birds back to her. The Raven comes with its obsidian eyes and lands on her shoulder. Flux follows suit eventually coaxing the Dove with the pearl eyes onto his shoulder. The birds above them form 
      arrows and they follow them. A sigil alights under their feet glowing blue. Two hands holding each other rest in the center of the sigil as they both stand on the outside. A mist enters and a chill alights 
      in the air. Arifel’s magic wanes here. They engage with the mist, only to be told they do not understand the magic involved here. Arifel imbued with Theodara’s cloak energy recognizes that this individual 
      is an Ancient from the time of the White Necromancer Queen. This is someone who is very powerful, ‘I rule’ sentiments and some kind of ritual was made in this location. The location was surrounded by trees 
      and a ruin in the background. He gets close to Arifel and says ‘I will have you. Either by my side or by soul.’ Arifel and Flux perplexed don’t quite understand as he relays two words, Soul Concordance to 
      them. They scene disappears as the bird’s poof from being and their feathers flutter to the ground. The aviary is empty. 
      <br><br>
      Flux and Arifel head back out through the vines. They all get past the vines until both Arifel and Flux crash through the floor falling into darkness where they both experience a vision. Then Arifel and Oak
      enter an anti-gravity section and float up toward spikes. Arifel spots a door and manages to along with Oak enter an enchanted library where the books create the stairwells and walls of this place and the 
      sky shines above them. Then comes along Iszal. He asks questions and they get one question they have answered. Oak wants to be a dad. Iszal then teleports them back down to The Garden past the gravity field.
      Flux then does this and learns Master Tormhall runs this place. Flux wishes to connect with someone on a deeper level. He to is transported to the other side of the gravity field. Gandra makes her way over 
      and Flux and Arifel take on the Vineheart. Flux touches it and as it ripples like Jello, it takes a swipe missing Flux. Arifel turns into a Giant Lizard as Flux barely chills the Vineheart with his touch. 
      Afterward, it swipes hitting both Arifel and Flux, knocking Arifel unconscious. Gandra alights her fire and burns it. The Garden begins to die as the light leeches out of the plant life. Oak does his best 
      to attack it as well. The Flux takes it down by lighting it on fire. The Vineheart burns and collapses upon itself dead as The Garden dies with it. Arifel takes a look inside and finds a Yellow Diamond and 
      an Old Key. 
      <br><br>
      A door is revealed to them and then burst through it into a bright room full of feasting individuals. Fiore Tormhall claps as they enter the room. He offers them a table to themselves with food from their 
      pasts. He offers answers in good faith revealing Akasha (with Raven Tattoo) and Nara and then Cienna. He also goes on about the history of the Gods, The Ancients, God Scar, and The White Necromancer Queen. 
      He was sent here by the Ancients as an Agent to root out this dark evil that has befallen Gravemarch. Reveals Devilayne is the culprit they are looking for. His evidence her showing up out of no where with 
      the phylactery. Speaking with something that isn’t of this world and no one can see. Always seems to show up just after the harrowing events have happened. Believes in the use of necromantic power for 
      anything even to save a life. The Anthorpe’s are the oldest and most powerful necromancy family, have been since they were created after the Queen’s demise. Said to be her direct descendants. This gave them
      power. The Elarocen house is the second most powerful and quite a wide margin of powerful higher than the rest of the houses. Her sights will be set on the Elarocen’s head of household soon, but has to 
      provoke them in a way that will force their hand. Devilayne is the most prominent necromancer in the city and is now the only Anthorpe left. Curious don’t you think. To take Devilayne on directly could leave
      Gravemarch and most of the north in ruins. We have a way of getting to her. Cienna and Nara. They were in danger so I had to act to protect my people. My Agents in the field. Enlists Flux’s and Arifel’s help
      to bring Devilayne down and ways to do so. This will require getting close to her (As close as need be to gain the knowledge, they need to defeat her) and look for the 7 Fragments. He offers 300 GP each for 
      assisting with finding the Fragments and information on Devilayne. Reward of 200 GP per Fragment found and offers an upfront fee of 150 GP. 
      <br><br>
      As Flux and Arifel talk to Nara and Cienna, the girls both tell them we will talk later and that Fiore is alright. Not to worry. Fiore can sense the distrust and reveals that she knows of Arifel’s sister and
      that a letter is arriving in Gravemarch for her when she gets back. Flux is told about the vision of his parents. Fiore is seemingly behind them and has been very straight with them thus far. Flux and Arifel
      agree to help although Arifel remains cautious. They both eat from the food and find it fully restores them to help and a feeling of safety within the castle walls. Rooms are provided as they head off to bed
      for the evening.</p>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Arifel and Flux sleep. 
        <br><br>
        Arifel has a memory from the Necromancer Queen and her son. She learns about the marks that necromantic spellcasters can obtain representing the soul of their magic. The Dove and the Raven can both stand 
        for light and dark and have many meanings. Yet the birds will always choose the caster not the other way around. The novel and children’s book versions of the Dove and the Raven have come down through 
        history and each have a different take on the story. The Queen bears the Dove and the Raven intertwined together meaning she is a Master of Necromancy both the light and the dark of it. The young boy 
        wants to be a Raven however she urges him to find the soulfulness of his magic. And the off chance that a spellcaster with a dove and a spellcaster with a raven find each other and fall in love, these are
        very powerful duos since they are parts of a whole magic.  
        <br><br>
        Flux dreams of playing with Nara as a young boy in the fields beyond Gravemarch. A smokey mist surrounds the dream until a misty figure, a man with chiseled features still all grey emerges. It speaks to 
        Flux a shame Nara will never truly love you in the way you want someone to know you. Someone though does know you, your truth. You’ve overlooked them in your time focused on everything else. Makes Flux 
        an offer to reveal them for a price. Flux remarks, “Kind of a solo act.” The mist urges him to forget Nara and move on from her.
        <br><br>
        They both wake in their rooms and meet in the hallway to begin their day of exploring the castle. They briefly talk about their dreams. The Queen has a son which Flux makes a note isn’t in any of the 
        current written history. They head to the library and chat with Iszal. Iszal being his crazy self, confirms that there are rumors surrounding the Necromancer Queen and her son, however there is no one 
        who was close enough to the Queen to even begin to confirm or deny these suspicions. Iszal provides Flux with The Stone That Remembers: A History of Castle Dopple. A book about its architectural history 
        and the former owners. The castle has had many and since it is in the Inter-dimension between Life and Death, the owners of the Castle make a Pact to remain here. It the Pact is broken they become a 
        living part of the Castle. The Original owners of the Castle were Twins and in fact Dopplegangers hence the name. This book also includes a map of the castle. It looks to be pretty old so it may not be 
        completely accurate. Iszal provides Arifel with Children of Stardust. A book about nursery tales about minor deities, fey, and prophetic beasts along with myths for young nobles. However, it does contain 
        a rather complete history of the 7 Noble Families of Gravemarch. A part is ripped out of the book pertaining to the Anthorpe history. Iszal enlists them to find this piece and is scared about being in 
        trouble for it.

        From the library they head to the Soul Room down a hallway light with blue flames. At the door, Arifel puts her hands in the depressions and the door seemingly opens as Flux doesn’t understand what she 
        saw that he didn’t. They step into a room with 7 crystals on stone stands in a circle around the room. A sigil in the floor is a thin silver crown surrounding a woman who is lit up in the middle. The 
        Necromancer Queen. They also discover that there is a language, a dove’s language only those with the mark of a dove speak. Only one crystal in the room glows all the time and another flickers and then 
        glows as Arifel gets closer to its. She proceeds to see herself, then Cienna, then a blonde ruffed up young man, and the same grey figures she had seen around her when she fell into the black gunk. She 
        then takes her crystal to the center over the sigil and disappears. Her crystal glows as Flux is left alone in the room. Arifel is transported to the same balcony room that was in her memory from last 
        night. The Queen stands overlooking Gravemarch. Hello dear. Not surprised why she was here. Arifel inquires about her son and she says that isn’t her concern. Right now, its figuring out who she is. The 
        Queen tells Arifel to look out and tell her what she sees. When she really looks Arifel sees a beautiful white magic ebbing and flowing between everyone and everything. The Queen reaches out to touch 
        Arifel’s heart. As she does it lights up under her hand and she leans in close. You are a fragment of myself. Arifel is transported back and puts it together that Arifel is one of the seven fragments of 
        the Necromancer Queen. So is Cienna and all the others. 
        <br><br>
        They then venture to Fiore’s office and when they knock, he welcomes them in. They speak for a few minutes about how to find a fragment. Fiore reveals that Akasha can taste it in their blood. They have 
        been trying to track them down for centuries however most are mortal and die so the fragments are displaced again. They also see Fiore’s wall of disappearance and murders along with letting them know 
        that Cedric Castyne is missing and has disappeared. He also reveals Cienna is a fragment and gives Arifel a knowing glance yet refrains from saying anything else.
        <br><br>
        They then venture to try and break into Fiore’s room. This isn’t very successful as they chat with Akasha instead. They learn that Akasha is very proud of her artifacts. Not much planning is done however 
        they establish they need a place in Gravemarch to lay low along with a plan of attack. Akasha shows of her skills of just how much she can gleam through a small amount of blood. Flux is from the north, 
        Rookstead and his parents are a mystery. Arifel is a young dragon from the south and tastes the fragment within her. As they all wrap up and leave, Flux decides to turn into Akasha and utilize her voice 
        to re-enter her room. Then they snoop around finding a mirror that is a portal to Nara’s sanctuary. A carved Raven that Akasha took from Devilayne as they both went to school together and are not friends.
        Two letters from between the Dove and the Raven with hidden secrets that Akasha was trying to reveal. Akasha’s tome of her history of kills. None recent that are recognized, yet a few still in action 
        currently one of which being Nara. Akasha has probably killed around 1000 people and its 735 years old. Arifel let an Ancient into herself for assistance with revealing the history of the wood Raven. 
        Two circles now rest on her neck with a curved hook on them. The chest next to Akasha’s is empty and suggests Nara doesn’t actively live in the space. They grab what they have found and put the tome and 
        everything back as best they can. Flux leaves and locks the door by voice and takes his form again.
