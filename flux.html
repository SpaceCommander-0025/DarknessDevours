        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
          Flux is an orphan who has lived most his life in Rookstead. From a young age, he had to learn how to survive and with a few trips to and from Cinder, his calling was born. He taught himself the art of illusions and became known as <em>Flux the Magnificent, Master of Illusions</em>.
          Honing his skill, he found honorable and not so honorable ways of making coin to survive. From his undeniable charm to his charismatic invitations, people often don't resist handing coin or goods or even specialty items over to pay for his company. Even the Flame Courtesans
          enjoy his company and even let him visit them during the day.
          <br><br>
          Gravemarch soon became another stomping ground for Flux as the prestige of Mortalis Collegium setting on every sunrise, more and more people came to hear of his fabled illusions that could alter your life should you be lucky enough to witness one. While hanging around,
          students studying Necromancy fueled his desire to learn more of magic and the arcane. Amongst his illusions and traveling around with circuses that would come thru the area, he would drop in to Mortalis Collegium. Not a full time student by any means, but perhaps the very
          beginnings of a true Necromancer.
          <br><br>
          Flux has become good friends with Edrian Castyne and Nara Mortavec, both adept Necromancers from the Noble families of Gravemarch. Flux and Edrian bond on the nature of entertaining people, pranks and illusions, and having a good time. Nara on the other hand has taken to being
          Flux's teacher when it comes to Necromancy and the two have grown close almost like siblings. Nara confides in Flux often times about her own family and her dreams of getting out of Gravemarch and traveling. Maybe even doing shows with her abilities as the star. Flux trusts Nara
          in a way he doesn't usually trust people. He writes his own story and follows all his own rules from day to day.
